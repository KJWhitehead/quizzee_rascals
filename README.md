<h1>Quiz-E by Quizzie Rascals README.MD</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Quiz-E by Quizzie Rascals is an online quiz designed to allow users to test their general and subject-specific knowledge. It encourages replayability and ensures a broad target audience (age 13+), by offering the user the chance to vary difficulty, quiz length, and subject matter. It also provides the option to share Quiz-E with friends and family on social media.

## Landing page for first time users

The landing page allows users to provide their name so that they are greeted by name on return visits to personalise and improve user engagement.

## Options page (landing page for returning users) 

The Options page allows users to provide their name so that they are greeted by name on return visits. 

There are drop menus to adjust difficulty, category, how many questions, and question type. There is also a social media button to easily share Quiz-E. 

It displays the Quizzie Rascals brand logo clearly for brand recognition. It also provides the option to share Quiz-E with friends and family on social media.

 The quiz page presents questions and possible answers, with buttons clearly delineated against their background. 
 
 There is clear feedback when a user selects and then commits an answer. 
 
 It lets you know the correct answer if you were wrong. There is also an updating score display. 

 There is a restart button in case the user decides they want to start again.

## Design Choices

We selected a rich and colourful style, using bright high contrast colours. We want the user to feel immersed in the experience of visiting our website. We derived our colours from https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/
“Bright Accent Colors”
#242582
#553D67
#F64C72
#99738E
#2F2FA2

We selected the font style Poppins 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap'. It works well as a fun, slightly futuristic, slightly unusual font; but not unusual enough to overpower the rest of the page.

## Wire Frames


<strong>Landing page for First Time User followed by Options Pages for repeat users<br></strong>

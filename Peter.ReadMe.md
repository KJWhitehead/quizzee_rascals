Contact page: Will allow users to contact our artist directly using a responsive contact form, requesting phone number, email address, and a responsive message text box, which will allow the user to move easily towards commissioning their own pet portrait. The form will be unable to be submitted until all sections of the form are completed, including the email address in the correct format. There will be placeholder text that will allow the user to know our artist is available for commissions, or to answer any questions, and encouraging the user to get in touch.

## UX

<strong>Site Goals</strong>

## Features Left to Implement

We considered adding a price structure but assigned it a "wont have" on our kanban board, as it would be difficult to implement in the time available given the need for payment processing options etc, and potentially seen as gauche and detract from the value of the artist's work, having reviewed other artist's websites e.g.https://www.rayhart.com/rayhart

Considered a reviews section but defined it as a "won't have" given the time available. We felt that also it may appear somewhat gauche on an artistic website, and there were links to social media should provide access to reviews if desired by the user.

Phone number and email address not interactive which would be nice but ran out of time

Hover feature on social media links
